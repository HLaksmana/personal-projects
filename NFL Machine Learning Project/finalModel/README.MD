# NFL Machine Learning Project

In this project I used player positions to try and predict yards gained on a play. Ultimately the model was not very effective in its predictions but I gained valuable experiance working with large amounts of data in python and using machine learning libraries in python. 


The training data is too large to include in this repository.

The folder includes the final model, derived through different tests on various ML structures. Included is also the tests I wrote to make conclusions about the capability of the model.
