This project was my Undergraduate Thesis for my Mathematical Economics Major. Through out the process of creating this complete failure of a neural network, I learned a lot about machine learning and python. This project was my first large project in python and I selfishly used my economcis thesis as an opportunity to force myself to become more fluent in the python programming language. While the model was a failure, and I recieved a barely passing grade on the project, I cannot not stress how much I learned creating this monstrosity. 

If on the off chance you are an employer considering my application for a position, I include this project to show that I am eager to learn. An example of the risks I am willing to take to continually challenge myself. Even though this was my senior thesis, I decided to take a risk because I knew this project would help push me further towards the knowledge I wanted to achieve. I could have just done a normal statistical analysis on home prices in low income areas etc etc... but I had done that before, and many before me had. I wanted to try something new, and bring together my education in computer science and economics... Ultimately the project failed and my grade suffered, a risk I was willing to take. But I did gain a better understanding of technologies I found much more interesting. Hopefully I have given you a better understanding of me as a person, and as a candidate.
