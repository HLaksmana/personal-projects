This a collection of web scrappers written in Python using Selenium and Chromium to get financial data on various Bond related mutual funds. 
This project was done for a newsletter writter that released the relevant information on these mutual funds at the beggining of each month.
Prior to hiring me to write these scripts they would have to spend a significant amount of time naviagating various websites to get the most recent information updated at midnight at the month end. These scripts have drastically reduced the amount of time spent gathering data. On occassion these scripts depreciate when website updates occur, I periodically update them when this happens.
